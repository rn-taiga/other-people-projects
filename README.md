**Other People Projects**
----------

*This list presents the projects of other people, written in Lisp, or relating to Lisp programming language*

----------


**[ub-lisp](https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/ub-lisp)**<br>
Translation of Uber Lisp article into russian.


**[roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell)**<br>
Roswell is a Lisp implementation installer/manager, launcher, and much more!
Roswell started out as a command-line tool with the aim to make installing and managing Common Lisp implementations really simple and easy.
Roswell has now evolved into a full-stack environment for Common Lisp development, and has many features that makes it easy to test, share, and distribute your Lisp applications. With Roswell, we aim to push the Common Lisp community to a whole new level of productivity.


**[shelly](https://github.com/fukamachi/shelly)**<br>
Shelly enables you to execute Common Lisp functions like a shell command. And it also can be used as a Make-like build-tool.
Shelly has the following features:
 - Provides shell command-like interface for Common Lisp functions;
 - Dumps a Lisp core for fast execution;
 - Allows to define projectspecific commands (shlyfile);
 - Implementation independent.


**[avesh](https://gitlab.com/ralt/avesh)**<br>
A Very Extensible Shell.<br>
The goal of avesh is to be super extensible. The point is to be able to hack around the shell as much as we want.
Bash and zsh, although powerful, have fairly limited hackability. One thing I wanted to do was being able to prevent a command from running, and run something else instead. I couldn't. With avesh, I can.


**[PIC](https://github.com/takagi/pic)**<br>
PIC Is a Compiler for 8-bit PIC micro controllers.
A native compiler for 8-bit PIC micro controllers written in Common Lisp. The host language is a pretty small subset of ML-like language and the target language is 8-bit PIC micro controller assembly. Common Lisp is the compiler language.


<b>[fukamachi/.emacs.d](https://github.com/fukamachi/.emacs.d)</b><br>
This is an example of configuration files for Emacs program from fukamachi [fukamachi](https://github.com/fukamachi).


**[Yalo](https://github.com/whily/yalo)**<br>
Yalo is a Lisp OS running on bare metal x86-64 hardware. The system programming language is Ink, a new Lisp dialect which combines the elegance of Scheme and powerfulness of Common Lisp.


**[Movitz](https://common-lisp.net/project/movitz/movitz.html)**<br>
Movitz is a Common Lisp OS development platform, writen by Frode Vatvedt Fjeld <frodef@acm.org> in 2004.<br>
Fork on githab is [here](https://github.com/dym/movitz) and [here](https://github.com/grepz/Movitz).

<b>[WCL](https://github.com/wadehennessey/wcl)</b><br>
The goal of WCL is to allow hundreds of Lisp applications to be realistically available at once, while allowing several of them to run concurrently.  WCL accomplishes this by providing Common Lisp as a Unix shared library that can be linked with Lisp and C code to produce efficient applications.

**[asdf-linguist](https://github.com/eudoxia0/asdf-linguist)**<br>
ASDF-linguist is a set of extensions to the ASDF build system for Common Lisp for compiling various languages and running various preprocessing tools (Sass, LESS, etc.) on files in your project.

**[sbcl-compiler-memo](https://github.com/guicho271828/sbcl-wiki/wiki)**<br>
Memos for understanding the internals of SBCL's native compiler.

**[scsh](https://scsh.net/about/about.html)**<br>
Implementation of UNIX scripts on Scheme.

**[simulate-avr-cpu](https://github.com/tobbelobb/simulate-avr-cpu)**<br>
This code is meant to simulate the state of an AVR microprocessor like the ATmega 328 or similar.

**[Staapl](http://zwizwa.be/staapl/staapl.html)**<br>
Staapl is a macro assembler on steroids for PIC18F microcontrollers. It can be used for writing firmware optimized for size. It goes where C canâ€™t go, and where assembler would be too complicated. It is based on Racket Scheme (code generator) and Forth (low-level language and machine model).

**[Armpit Scheme](http://armpit.sourceforge.net)**<br>
Armpit Scheme is an interpreter for the Scheme language (lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp) that runs on RISC microcontrollers with ARM core.
